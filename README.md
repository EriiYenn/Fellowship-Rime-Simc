# Notes
I wont offer any help running or using this software. If you are unfamiliar with Python, I'm sorry but I can't help.

## How to Run
- In the main.py edit your character with your Character points.
- Modify your talents by uncommenting/commenting the values.
- Adjust Priority rotation by moving spells around.
- Choose to run average_dps, stat_weights, or a blanket sim with debug by uncommenting what you want to run.
- It will output to console.
