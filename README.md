# Notes
This is by no means complete. I just figured I'd make it open source and maybe someone else will come along and do something while I go to sleep, or maybe someone will want to run it themselves. Who knows?

## How to Run
- In the main.py edit your character with your Character points.
- Choose to run average_dps, stat_weights, or a blanket sim with debug by uncommenting what you want to run.
- It will output to console.
