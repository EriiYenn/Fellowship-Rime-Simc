# Notes
This is by no means complete. I just figured I'd make it open source and maybe someone else will come along and do something while I go to sleep, or maybe someone will want to run it themselves. Who knows?

## What works?
- Priority Rotation for Single Target only.
- Buffs: Wrath of Winter + Ice Blitz
- Talents: Chillblain, Soulfrost Torrent, Wisdom of the North, Coalescing Ice, Glacial Assault

## What doesn't work?
- Multi Target Rotations.
- Buffs: Winter's Blessing
- Talents: Avalanche

## How to Run
- In the main.py edit your character with your Character points.
- Choose to run average_dps, stat_weights, or a blanket sim with debug by uncommenting what you want to run.
- It will output to console.
